Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting numerical data. It provides methods and techniques for making inferences and decisions in the presence of uncertainty. The primary goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data, enabling us to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the information available.

In essence, statistics allows us to make sense of the vast amounts of data that surround us in various fields such as science, economics, social sciences, engineering, and many others. It plays a crucial role in decision-making processes, research, policy formulation, and understanding the world around us.
