# STATISTICS
## Definition of Statistics:

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting numerical data. It provides methods and techniques for making inferences and decisions in the presence of uncertainty. The primary goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data, enabling us to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the information available.

In essence, statistics allows us to make sense of the vast amounts of data that surround us in various fields such as science, economics, social sciences, engineering, and many others. It plays a crucial role in decision-making processes, research, policy formulation, and understanding the world around us.

# TYPES OF STATISTICS
Statistics can be broadly classified into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. These methods include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of dispersion (such as range, variance, and standard deviation), and graphical techniques (such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots). Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic characteristics of the data, providing insights into its distribution, variability, and shape.

## 2.Inferential Statistics:
Inferential statistics involve using sample data to make inferences or predictions about a larger population. This branch of statistics allows us to draw conclusions, test hypotheses, and make predictions based on the analysis of sample data. Common techniques in inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and correlation analysis. Inferential statistics enables researchers to generalize findings from a sample to the population, provided certain assumptions are met.
